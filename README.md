# Smart City Living
A sub-division of UBC Smart City, building IoT products to modernize living environment.

## Streetlight
The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) presents an opportunity for cities to address these challenges and modernize their streetlights. By connecting streetlights to a central network, municipalities can monitor and control their lights in real-time, reducing energy consumption, and lowering maintenance costs. IoT sensors can be integrated into streetlights to collect data on traffic patterns and weather conditions, providing cities with valuable insights to optimize their lighting systems and better serve their citizens.

Our team proposes a streetlight system that provides:
1. Decreased Energy Consumption
2. Eased of Maintenance
3. Improved Health Consideration
4. Emerging Technology

### Prototype 
##### MCU
- STM32F4

##### Sensors

-What the point of the project is (we are making a flying car!) 
-why it was hard (we encountered this problem that was unexpected. It had never been done before) 
-what you did (individual work? Led a team? Did the heavy lifting?) 
-what the outcome was. Did it work? What did you learn? What would you do differently? Why didn't you do that in the first place?
